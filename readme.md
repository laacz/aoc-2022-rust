# Advent of Code 2022 (rust version)

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

My main approach is [using Go](https://github.com/laacz/aoc-2022). This might not even see the light of github. 

Rust is not my go-to language. However, occasionally coding in it gives me some weird pleasure.

## Day 1

Easy.
