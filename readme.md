# Advent of Code 2022 (rust version)

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

My main try this year [is using Go](https://github.com/laacz/aoc-2022). This might not get finished.

Rust is not my go-to language. However, occasionally coding in it gives me some weird pleasure, though I have to take a break after a session with it. It's rewarding, but learning curve is steep - takes my breath away ;)

## Day 1

Easy.

## Day 2

Easy. Crime: irresponsive use of an enum.

## Day 3

Easy. Guilty of not figuring out better way to get the priority from a char.

## Day 4

Ranges rock.

## Day 5

Just bruted it. Got into fight with types and borrowing. Will read up before next one.
